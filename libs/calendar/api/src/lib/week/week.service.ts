   *
   * Algorithm is to find nearest thursday, it's year
   * is the year of the week number. Then get weeks
   * between that date and the first day of that year.
   *
   * Note that dates in one year can be weeks of previous
   * or next year, overlap is up to 3 days.
   *
   * e.g. 2014/12/29 is Monday in week  1 of 2015
   *      2012/1/1   is Sunday in week 52 of 2011
